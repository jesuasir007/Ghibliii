## About
This started as a way for me to do something in this quarantine time.
I was watching Spirited away and My neighbor totoro when i was strucked with the idea of creating a simple
app as a way to tell each movies. 

This app uses apple's latest iOS 13+ API (as a way for me to practice too) instead of the old methods in displaying collections.
Feel free to submit a PR because contribution is always fun!

## Installation
Clone this repo, build, and run!
