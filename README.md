## About
This started as a way for me to do something in this quarantine time. I was watching Spirited away and My neighbor totoro when i was strucked with the idea of creating a simple app as a way to tell each movies and marked them as watched (since i am actually enjoying them!) 

This app uses apple's latest iOS 13+ API (as a way for me to practice too) instead of the old methods in displaying collections.
Feel free to submit a PR because contribution is always fun!
